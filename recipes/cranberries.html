        but have you tried it in muffins? This easy recipe for cranberry muffins uses a cup of your smooth or chunky leftover cranberry sauce. 
        The batter comes together in minutes and the moist, sweet muffins are perfect for a post-Thanksgiving breakfast or snack.</h2>
    <p>These leftover cranberry sauce muffins are the perfect way to make the most of every last bit of your Thanksgiving meal.</p>

    <ul>
        <li><b>Flour:</b> Two cups of all-purpose flour give these leftover cranberry sauce muffins structure.</li>
        <li><b>Sugar:</b> Use a combination of white and brown sugar for ultimate sweetness.</li>
        <li><b>Baking powder:</b> Baking powder acts as a leavener, which means it makes the batter rise and creates a fluffy texture.</li>

        <li><b>Leftover cranberry sauce:</b> You can use homemade or store-bought cranberry sauce.</li>

        <li><b>Oil:</b> Vegetable oil adds moisture without imparting any flavor.</li>
